//! Simple Sketch's skills for the assistant: everything a person does to a
//! sketch's contents by hand, as tools. They are built from the hand
//! surface, not from a list of shapes: the brush, eraser, shape, text, and
//! select gestures; the commands that change contents; every property the
//! panel and outliner edit on objects, text, and palette colors; and the
//! select tool's selection. Each tool runs the session's own path for that
//! hand action (see `session/assist.rs`), so its undo, document, and save
//! are a hand edit's. Undo and redo stay with the person.
