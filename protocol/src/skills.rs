//! What a sub-application tells the assistant it can do, and how the host
//! asks it to do one thing.
//!
//! A sub-application declares its skills as data with `skills`. Each skill
//! has instructions for the assistant and tools, each with a JSON Schema for
//! its input. The host offers every running sub-application's tools to the
//! assistant, and when the assistant calls one, sends `invoke`. The
//! sub-application carries it out through the same path its hand actions
//! take, sends any `document` or `tabs` the call caused, then answers with
//! `result`. The host and the assistant never know a skill or tool by name.
